# Lyric Library

Lyric library is a web application for searching, storing, editing, and organizing song lyrics. It is designed and built with singers, songwriters and performers in mind, but works equally well for poets, lyricists, novelists, or anybody wanting to organize short pasages of text.

## About

The Lyric library application was born out of a personal struggle to organize and remember songs I enjoy singing and playing. As a music enthusiast, how often do you find yourself sitting at the piano or picking up a guitar to bash through a tune, only for your mind to go blank when coming up with a song to play.
